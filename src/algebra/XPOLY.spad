++ Description:
++ This type supports multivariate polynomials whose set of variables 
++ is \spadtype{Symbol}. The representation is recursive.
++ The coefficient ring may be non-commutative and the variables 
++ do not commute. However, coefficients and variables commute.

XPolynomial(R) == CODE where
  R : Ring

  CODE ==> XRecursivePolynomial(Symbol, R)
